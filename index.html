            Ingredients you'll need:
        </h2>
        <ol>
            <li> - 2 pieces of bread</li>
            <li>- 2 pats of butter</li>

            Process:
        </h2>
        <ol>
            <li> Fetch yourself a fat-bottom skillet</li>
            <li> Heat the skillet over medium heat</li>
            <li> Butter one side of each slice of bread</li>
            <li> Place one slice of the buttered bread, buttered side down, into the skillet</li>
            <li> Quickly place each slice of cheese on the bread, being sure to cover the entire surface area</li>
            <li> Place the other slice of bread, butter side up, on top of the cheese</li>
            <li> Wait approximately 1 to 2 minutes (or till the bread touching the skillet is a golden brown)</li>
            <li> Flip the sandwich over with some awesome pizazz and cook the other side till golden brown
                (approximately 1 to 2 minutes)</li>
            <li> Eat with ketchup, or just enjoy the plain crispy goodness of your grilled cheese</li>

            <strong>Note:</strong>
            <p>Grilled cheese is great on a grill, but for a quicker method, try using a clamshell panini press. The
                result will be much quicker, allowing you to make many more for you and your friends.

                Remember, Shaun says "Grilled cheese sandwiches are a staple of the North American diet!".</p>
